## Key Features

- **Home Page:** Users land on the home page where they can navigate to job list by clicking the `Explore Jobs` button.
- **Job List Page:** The job list page displays available jobs in descending chronological order.
  Each job card includes `Read More` button where the user can navigate to `Job Details Page`
  and `More` and `Less` buttons to control the display of job description
  (limited to 90 characters initially, avoiding word truncation).
  Initially, six jobs are loaded, with a `Load More Jobs` button to fetch more as needed.
- **Job Details Page:** Each job has a dedicated details page, providing comprehensive information about the job,
  including three buttons: `Back To Job List`, `Edit Job` and `Delete Job`.
- **Add & Edit Job Pages:** Users can add new jobs via a dedicated form and edit existing job details
  using a pre-filled form.
- **Contact Page:** This page is divided into two equal sections as following:
  `Left card` - contains `Jobify`â€™s address, email and phone number along with an embedded
  Google Map location.
  `Right card` - includes a contact form that allows users to send messages directly to `Jobify`.
  A success notification appears upon submission.
- **Loading Spinner:** A spinner is displayed while data is loading on the job details, job list and edit job pages.
- **Notifications:** Confirmation messages appear after adding, editing or deleting a job and when successfully
  submitting the contact form.
- **404 Page:** A `PageNotFound.vue` file is included to handle non-existent routes.
